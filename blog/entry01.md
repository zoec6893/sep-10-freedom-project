# Entry 1: Choosing My Subject (Mental Health)
##### 10/23/23

### Why did I choose Mental Health?

There were many topics I could have chosen when it came to my freedom project, but I skimmed through a lot of them and I ended up choosing mental health. I chose this topic because I feel like there is a bad stigma when it comes to technology in terms of mental health. When you hear the words "Mental Health" and "Technology" together in the same sentence it is never for a good reason, it always ends up being about how mental health negatively affects technology in some way. If we're being honest though this can be true most times, what we use technology and the internet for can be pretty damaging for our mental health, that is why I chose mental health over () and () (my two other options), to show a way where we can use technology to solve a problem with mental health instead of causing one. I used sources like [Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/technology-and-the-future-of-mental-health-treatment) by the _National Institute of Mental Health_ and [How Does Technology Effect Mental Health?](https://onlinedegrees.bradley.edu/blog/how-does-technology-affect-mental-health/) to do research on technology and its impact on mental health, to find ways to counteract this and innovate in a way where it can help better someone else's mental health.

### Engineering Design Process

So far I haven't really progressed too far in my overall project, though I have found the main problem I want to be fixed when it comes to technology and mental health, that being the stigma put onto technology. So I want to find a way to implement technology into mental health, but in a positive way. I am going to do this by researching evidence from articles and getting advice from my peers and teachers.

### Skills

Some skills I've learnt from doing this project are **Time Management** and **Using Google**

## Time Management 

I am apart of a lot of classes that give a lot of homework so I must find a way to manage my time in order to continue going about doing my everyday after school commitments, and to continue doing my homework on time and regularly. My dive into mental health has also taught me about how important sleep is and about how electronics like phones and tablets can cause people to lose sleep for a variety of reasons, so I need to keep up with my time managment when it comes to my work and when it comes to my screen time.

## Using Google

All the research I've done into my subject has allowed me to really learn about using google to find the things I need to look for, I would have probably just searched the term "mental health" and researched that for a little while but in class we learned that it would be a lot more beneficial if we searched for what we are looking for specifically. We learned to use terms like "technology" and "computer science" in order to find more specific information for what we're looking for.

### Summary
I am excited to create a website for technology when it comes to mental health because it is something that is very important and is something that everyoe can use to benefit themselves!
