### Why did I choose Mental Health?

There were many topics I could have chosen when it came to my freedom project, but I skimmed through a lot of them and I ended up choosing mental health. I chose this topic because I feel like there is a bad stigma when it comes to technology in terms of mental health. When you hear the words "Mental Health" and "Technology" together in the same sentence it is never for a good reason, it always ends up being about how mental health negatively effects technology in some way. If we're being honest though this can be true most times, what we use technology and the internet for can be pretty damaging for our mental health, that is why I chose mental health over () and () (my two other options), to show a way where we can use technology to solve a problem with mental health instead of causing one. I used sources like [Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/technology-and-the-future-of-mental-health-treatment) by the _National Institute of Mental Health_ and [How Does Technology Effect Mental Health?](https://onlinedegrees.bradley.edu/blog/how-does-technology-affect-mental-health/) to do research on technology and its impact on mental health, to find ways to counteract this and innovate in a way where it can help better someone elses mental health.
